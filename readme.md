I want all the achievements but I'm shit at rythim games.

How to use:
- Load the script for the stage
- Skip tutorial
- Press Shift+1 when song is running, the skript will restart the stage and play trough it.

Even if you don't get all Perfects it's fine, I couldn't be bothered to sync them more up and even half of all notes being mediocore is enough to get 3 Stars
